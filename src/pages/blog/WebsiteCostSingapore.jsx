      <h2>Factors Affecting Website Costs</h2>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Design Complexity:</strong> Custom designs cost more than templates</li>
        <li><strong>Functionality Requirements:</strong> Advanced features increase development time</li>
        <li><strong>Content Creation:</strong> Professional copywriting and photography services</li>
        <li><strong>SEO and Marketing:</strong> Search engine optimization and digital marketing setup</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance and Support:</strong> Ongoing updates, security, and technical support</li>
        <li><strong>Hosting and Domain:</strong> Annual costs for website hosting and domain registration</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hidden Costs to Consider</h2>
      
      <p>
        Beyond initial development, consider ongoing expenses like hosting ($200-$1,000/year), domain registration ($15-$50/year), SSL certificates, content updates, and technical support. Many agencies offer maintenance packages that include regular updates, security monitoring, and performance optimization.
      </p>

      <h2>ROI and Value Considerations</h2>
      
      <p>
        While cost is important, focus on the value your website delivers. A well-designed website can generate leads, increase sales, and improve customer engagement. Consider the lifetime value of customers acquired through your website when evaluating investment decisions.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "Invest in a website that grows with your business. The right website pays for itself through increased leads, sales, and customer engagement."
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Getting the Best Value</h2>
      
      <p>
        Request detailed quotes from multiple agencies, compare features included, and ask about ongoing support. Look for agencies that understand your business goals and can provide case studies of similar projects. Remember, the cheapest option isn't always the best value in the long run.
